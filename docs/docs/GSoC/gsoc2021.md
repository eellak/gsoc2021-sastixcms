# 2021

**Assignee**: Ilias Kyranas

**Mentor**: Ioannis Skitsas

## Abstract

The year 2021 is the first year Sastix CMS made it to GSoC projects.
The Sastix-CMS is a CMS solution based on the robust Spring Boot
framework. Up until now the CMS provided a REST API offering
functionality for managing resources, using a distributed cache
system to consume them. The goal of this project is consisted of
creating a frontend client to consume resources from the CMS server
and providing the monitoring capabilities to handle high volumes of
traffic. The frontend implementation should provide a common
interface for Administrators and Content Creators/Consumers of the
Sastix CMS and extend the current capabilities of the server to
support multitenant API calls. The provided solution will support
multirole access and authorization, simple, secure flows and
multi-device deployment using Flutter. The solution will provide
monitoring solutions for the application and scalability using Docker
and Kubernetes. The work includes tools to benchmark the deployments,
deployment artifacts to easily deploy the stack and thorough
documentation of the functionality using Docusaurus.

## Implementation Stories

The central objectives of the deliverable can be grouped in the
implementation "Stories" (S) provided below:

- Frontend implementation (S1).
- User management, authentication and authorization (S2).
- Extension of backend features (S3).
- Monitoring and alerts (S4).
- Performance improvements, testing and deployment artifacts (S5).

:::info

In the community bonding period of GSoC it was agreed by the mentor
and the assignee to use Flutter instead of the React-Next.js
framework as described in the proposal.

During the period of GSoC selection of organizations and students
Flutter released a version production-ready for the web. Using a
single codebase the Flutter client could target all the major
platforms. All Next.js features (internationalization, image
optimization, SEO features) are supported by the Flutter ecosystem
and native applications will be deployed, avoiding the Javascript
bridge overhead.
